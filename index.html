        <h1>Cropology</h1>
        <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to global food security. As temperatures rise, precipitation patterns shift, and land quality evolves, understanding how these changes impact agricultural productivity is critical. In Cropology, we visualize the relationship between environmental stressors and crop yields worldwide, using historical data to uncover patterns and project future risks. Our aim is to inform policy, guide resource allocation, and empower more resilient farming systems.</p>

        <h2>Temperature Changes - A Global Disruptor</h2>
        <p>Rising temperatures are already reshaping agricultural landscapes. Some regions experience longer growing seasons, while others face heat stress and water scarcity. By visualizing global temperature anomalies alongside crop yields, we reveal hotspots where warming is strongly correlated with productivity decline—particularly in equatorial and semi-arid zones. These insights underscore the urgency of adaptive strategies like heat-tolerant crops and improved irrigation systems.</p>

        <h2>Use of Pesticides</h2>
        <p>Pesticides play a dual role in agriculture—protecting crops from pests but potentially harming long-term soil health and ecosystems. Our visualization shows how pesticide usage has changed over time across regions and how it aligns with yield patterns. In some high-use countries, yields have stabilized, but others show diminishing returns, suggesting possible overuse or resistance. This calls for more balanced, targeted approaches to crop protection.</p>

        <h2>Soil Nutrient Composition</h2>
        <p>Fertile soil is the backbone of productive farming. By analyzing key nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—we explore how soil balance influences yield outcomes. The data shows that while fertilizer application boosts yields, excessive or imbalanced use leads to nutrient runoff and declining effectiveness. Regions with optimized nutrient profiles tend to maintain more stable productivity over time, highlighting the value of precision agriculture and sustainable soil management.</p>

        <h2>Overall Crop Yield</h2>
        <p>This interactive global map presents a spatial overview of crop yield performance over time. Users can explore country-level trends, compare different crops, and correlate yield patterns with climate and input variables. It reveals striking disparities: while some regions have seen steady improvements, others face stagnation or decline. The map serves as a powerful tool to identify both opportunity areas and regions at risk.</p>
