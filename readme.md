# Cropology: Climate, Crops, and Consequences
Cropology is a data visualization project that explores the complex relationship between global climate variables and agricultural productivity. Using historical and projected data, the project highlights how changes in temperature, precipitation, pesticide usage, and soil nutrient balance impact crop yields across the world.

## Objective
The goal of Cropology is to:
- Investigate the impact of climate change on crop yield.
- Visualize global trends in temperature, fertilizer and pesticide usage, and soil health.
- Provide an intuitive and interactive platform for users to explore these relationships.

## Visualizations
**Temperature Changes Over Time**
- A heatmap showing rising land temperatures globally, with red hues intensifying over the years.

**Pesticide Usage Across Countries**
- A comparison of pesticide application trends, with focus on anomalous increases in countries like Brazil.

**Soil Nutrient Composition**
- A map of nutrient surplus and deficit regions, highlighting soil imbalance issues in various countries.

**Interactive Global Crop Yield Map**
- A central map visualization allowing users to explore how climate variables correlate with crop yield trends, including projections under different climate models.

## Datasets Used
- Crops and Livestock Products (FAO)
- Cropland Nutrient Balance
